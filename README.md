A **trigger** is a special function in SQL that automatically executes a specified action when a specific event happens in a database table. These events can include operations like **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, or **DELETE**.

## How Does a Trigger Work?

A trigger follows three main steps:

1. **Event**: When will the trigger activate? This is usually specified as an event like **BEFORE INSERT** or **AFTER UPDATE**.
2. **Condition**: What condition or check needs to be satisfied for the trigger to execute?
3. **Action**: What action will the trigger take if the condition is met? This could be anything from inserting data to showing an error message.
